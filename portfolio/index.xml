      <description>This 1920s Californian bungalow in the heart of Ashburton was completely transformed into a beautiful grand home with each area serving a purpose.
A minimalistic design ensured the Carrara marble and ravine joinery were the standout heroes while re-instating the character of the home by keeping the dental cornicing, original lead-light windows and whitewashed original hardwood flooring.</description>

      <description>This beachside apartment was in need of some brightening as the original chocolate joinery and black marble stone seemed to be much too dark and clashed with the original brunette polished stone tundra flooring and the water front views.</description>

      <description>This 1980s suburban home was last renovated in 2005, however after 16 years the peachy dolphin tiles and orange floorboards definitely needed an upgrade, not to mention all the discoloured chrome tap wear and dated joinery throughout.</description>
